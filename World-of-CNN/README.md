A curated collection of Convolutional Neural Network projects from my ML journey. Each project contains a notebook, model code, and a short report.

## Current projects
- **Handwritten Digit Recognition (MNIST)** — basic CNN, data preprocessing, model visualization, and error analysis.
- **Fashion Item Classification (Fashion-MNIST)** — deeper CNN, augmentation, class-wise analysis (in progress).

## Goals
- Learn advanced CNN patterns (BatchNorm, Dropout, Residual blocks)
- Use augmentation and regularization to handle difficult classes
- Produce clear writeups and reproducible notebooks for each project

## Structure
Each project folder will contain:
- `notebook.ipynb` (Colab-friendly notebook)
- `README.md` (project summary)

## Tools
Python, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, Google Colab

Happy learning — more projects coming soon!

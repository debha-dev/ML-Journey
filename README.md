# ML Journey

A structured, practical journey through Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Neural Network projects.

Welcome to ML Journey — a personal learning repository documenting my progress in Machine Learning and AI.
This repo contains well-organized projects, each focusing on a different ML concept, dataset, or architecture, with clear explanations, reports, and reproducible notebooks.

This repository is built to serve as:
✔️ A portfolio for recruiters and internship applications
✔️ A learning path showing constant growth
✔️ A collection of complete projects with documentation
✔️ A reference hub for future ML experiments
